###  Research Interests  
I work at the intersection of **probability theory, machine learning, and financial modeling**, with an emphasis on uncertainty-aware methods and explainable decision systems.

My current focus includes:  
- 📌 Gaussian Processes & Bayesian Optimization  
- 📌 Stochastic Calculus & Martingales  
- 📌 Time-Series Forecasting for Markets  
- 📌 Reinforcement Learning in Finance  
- 📌 Portfolio Optimization & Risk Engineering
