###  Research Interests  
I work at the intersection of **probability theory, machine learning, and financial modeling**, with an emphasis on uncertainty-aware methods and explainable decision systems.

My current focus includes:  
-  Gaussian Processes & Bayesian Optimization  
-  Stochastic Calculus & Martingales  
-  Time-Series Forecasting for Markets  
-  Reinforcement Learning in Finance  
-  Portfolio Optimization & Risk Engineering
